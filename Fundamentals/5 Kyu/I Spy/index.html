      In testing, a spy function is one that keeps track of various metadata regarding its invocations. Some examples of properties that a spy might track include:

      Whether it was invoked
      How many times it was invoked
      What arguments it was called with
      What contexts it was called in
      What values it returned
      Whether it threw an error
      For this kata, implement a spyOn function which takes any function func as a parameter and returns a spy for func. The returned spy must be callable in the same manner as the original func, and include the following additional properties/methods:

      .callCount() — returns the number of times spy has been called
      .wasCalledWith(val) – returns true if spy was ever called with val, else returns false.
      .returned(val) — returns true if spy ever returned val, else returns false
      Below is a specific example of how spyOn might work in the wild.

      function adder(n1, n2) { return n1 + n2; }
      var adderSpy = spyOn( adder );

      adderSpy(2, 4); // returns 6
      adderSpy(3, 5); // returns 8
      adderSpy.callCount(); // returns 2
      adderSpy.wasCalledWith(4); // true
      adderSpy.wasCalledWith(0); // false
      adderSpy.returned(8); // true
      adderSpy.returned(0); // false
   -->

      function adder(n1, n2) { return n1 + n2; };

      function spyOn(func) {
         let count = 0;
         const calledWidth = [];
         const returned = [];

         const execute = function(...args) {
            count++;
            [...args].forEach(curr => calledWidth.push(curr));
            returned.push(func(...args));
            return func(...args);
         }
         execute.callCount = arg => count;
         execute.wasCalledWith = arg => calledWidth.indexOf(arg) != -1 ? true : false;
         execute.returned = arg => returned.indexOf(arg) != -1 ? true : false;
         return execute;
      }

      const adderSpy = spyOn( adder );

      console.log(adderSpy(2, 4));
      console.log(adderSpy(3, 5));
      console.log(adderSpy.callCount());
      console.log(adderSpy.wasCalledWith(4));
      console.log(adderSpy.wasCalledWith(0));
      console.log(adderSpy.returned(8));
      console.log(adderSpy.returned(0));
